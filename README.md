# terminal_typer
A Rust command-line typing game to acquaint with the language.

# Playing the game

First, run the executable with `--help` to read the game's options.
A file that contains words in it is necessary.  There are a few wordlists in the repository.  I recommend "popular.txt".
Feed the executable wordlist file as an argument in the command line.
On game over, the program will write your score to a file in the same directory.
